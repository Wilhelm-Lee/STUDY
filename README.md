# Study - Prototype

Good news! Finally, after months of work, I have my chance to say it proudly, the prototype is officially released!

Not only it's a great milestone to my own, but also, it is a proof to my programming abilities on Java.

I definitely would have more better version to work on in the future. So, thank you all for scanning through my project! I appreciate it very much! \\(\^-\^)\/

And, as always...

Just in case, please let me explain some certain things.
