<h1 align="center">STUDY</h>

### Huh, what is this?

Glad you asked!

Origenally, it was a project which aimed to help myself better understanding Java. When time passes on, I had a even greater idea, which is what I am forcusing on right now -- rewritting Study with <u><b><font color="#FFFF00" size=4 face="Courier Prime">C</font></b></u>[arnival](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/Carnival "LinkToCarnival").

### What?

More questions? Should you be!

Study is similar to your terminal apps, or more like your interactive consoles. Within your <u><font color="#444444">~~__PENGUIN & GLASSES__~~</font></u> <font color="#FFFFFF">__Linux__</font> & <font color="#FFFFFF">__Windows__</font> (or perhaps <font color="#FFFFFF">__MacOS__</font> as well), you can use both system commands and Study commands to help you solve daily needs:

- [X] FileManagement (VerAbove. Oct1st2022_PROTOTYPE)
- [ ] ToDoList
- [ ] Reminders
- [ ] AlarmClock
- [ ] TextEditor
- [ ] Programming
- [ ] MusicPlayer

And don't even mention we could have <u><b><font color="#FF9900" size=4 face="Noto Serif Display Black">X</font></b></u>[11](https://x.org/wiki/) support for this very Project to "Study" on -- <u><b><i><font color="#FF9900" size=4 face="Noto Serif Display Black">X</font></i></b></u>[STUDY](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/Xstudy)

### Fine, fine. But install?

Ahh, name of the game! [PepeClap][EasyClap]

<b><font size=5>Scenario I</font></b>

Please make sure that you have your Java properties installed properly:

<font face="Courier Prime">

> [Windows](https://www.java.com/en/download/windows_manual.jsp "WindowsJavaInstallLink")

</font>

<u><b><font color="#FFFFFF">ArchLinux:</font></b></u> (My OS)
```sh
sudo pacman -S java17-openjfx && sudo pacman -Syy
```

<u><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Ubuntu:</font></b></u>
```sh
sudo apt install default-jdk default-jre && sudo apt update
```

<font face="Courier Prime">

> [MacOS](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk19-mac)

</font>

<u><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Android:</font></b></u>

As the majority of mobile device OS, it is important to someone like geek to have a classic terminal UI interactive console toolset to control their devices. 

Full power-on match presented by Andoird and Study.

We announce <u><b><i><font color="#33CC00" size=4 face="Noto Serif">A</font></i></b></u>[ttraction](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/Attraction).

It support more SWEET features, tendencies to programming, GUI interacting and portability.

Code Editor, Code Compiler, Code Executor are all included.

Isn't that attractive?

<u><b><font color="#FFFFFF">IOS:</font></b></u>

We are sorry.

<u><b><font color="#FFFFFF">ChromeOS:</font></b></u>

<b><font size=5>Scenario II</font></b>

Here, once you have downloaded files in a zip or directly using __git__, what you need to do is to make the project into a "__.jar__" file. Then you can start running it.

Take a look.

```sh
jar cf nameItYourOwn.jar projectFolderPath/*
java -jar nameItYourOwn.jar
```

The Janet and John bit:
```sh
jar cf study.jar Study/*
java -jar study.jar
```

Everything is going well? Good job!

If not, please jump to [TrobbleShooting](#iv-got-a-problemtrobbleshooting)

Now if you are a Linux user, the following command can make you start conveniently:
```sh
sudo # This README is not done yet, please be aware.
```
