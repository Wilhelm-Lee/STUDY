# Study

Just in case, please let me explain some certain things.

This README along with the project you've seen or about to see are still in early development.

Feel free to leave a comment if there were any valuable\* suggestions. Or if you want to just complain about some specific disadvantages from the project, just write down or send to me via email, thank you!

**Your attentions are the greatest encouragement to me, Thanks again!**

## Purpose
1. *Regular computer tool* ( File management etc. )
2. *Todo List* ( \*honk\* )
3. *Good old alarm*
4. *Music box* ( Local music player )
5. *Calculator*
6. *Word searching* ( Like a dictionary without explainations but words and words only )
7. What else... Oh, that's it

## Features
1. Terminal Interface
2. For Linux terminal only |:P
3. Might cost a lot to develop, but still feels cheap ( Is that my problem? IDK honestly )
4. One that alone, one that only, develops. Me.
